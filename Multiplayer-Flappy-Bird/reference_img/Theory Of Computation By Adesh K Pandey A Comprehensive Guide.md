# Theory Of Computation By Adesh K Pandey: A Comprehensive Guide
 
Theory of computation is a branch of computer science that studies the nature and limitations of computational models, such as automata, formal languages, grammars, algorithms, and complexity classes. It is a fundamental subject that provides the theoretical foundations for various fields of computing, such as compiler design, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and programming languages.

One of the popular books on theory of computation is "An Introduction to Automata Theory and Formal Languages" by Adesh K Pandey, published by S.K. Kataria & Sons. This book covers the basic concepts and principles of automata theory and formal languages in a clear and concise manner. It also provides numerous examples, exercises, and solved problems to help students understand and apply the concepts.
 
The book is divided into 12 chapters, covering topics such as finite automata, regular expressions, regular languages, context-free grammars, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive and recursively enumerable languages, decidability and undecidability, complexity theory, NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms. The book also includes appendices on mathematical preliminaries, proof techniques, and sample question papers.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science and engineering, as well as for those who are preparing for competitive examinations like GATE, NET, and SET. The book is available in both print and digital formats. However, some students may prefer to download the book for free from various online sources.
 
One of the websites that offers the book for free download is [ebooknetworking.net](https://www.ebooknetworking.net/ebooks/theory-of-computation-by-adesh-k-pandey.html). This website provides a link to download the PDF version of the book from another website called [pdfdrive.com](https://www.pdfdrive.com/theory-of-computation-by-adesh-k-pandey-ebooks.html).
